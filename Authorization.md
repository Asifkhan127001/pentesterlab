# Authorization

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a given user or client. In other words, it involves making sure that they really are
who they claim to be. At least in part, websites are exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet by design. Therefore, robust authentication
mechanisms are an integral aspect of effective web security. 

There are three authentication factors into which different types of authentication can be categorized: 


Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes referred to as "knowledge factors".
Something you have, that is, a physical object like a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes referred to as "possession factors".
Something you are or do, for example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes referred to as "inherence factors".

Authentication mechanisms rely on a range of technologies to verify one or more of these factors.
